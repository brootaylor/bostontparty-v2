Don't worry, all the important information will still be available but the way the website looks will evolve and get better over time. So please bear with us as we improve things *'under the bonnet'* and hopefully make your experience of the Boston T Party website even better &mdash; no matter what device you choose to visit us on.

## Some new features

Here are some features we've implemented so far to hopefully enhance your experience of the Boston T Party website:

* ***'Responsive'* content** &mdash; This means the content on this website will repurpose / lay itself out optimally on whatever device or screen size you choose to use. Most importantly, this means the website should be far easier to use on a mobile device.
* ***'Accessible'* content** &mdash; We've tried to [make our website as accessible and usable as possible][1]. While we know that it is impossible to design a site that everyone can use, if you have problems using our site, please [let us know][2] and we will do our utmost to help.
* ***'Offline'* content** &mdash; Once you've visited our website once, we've made it possible for your device to hold a copy of the most important pages / content. This means that you will still be able to view this content even if you lose connection to the internet / data for some reason &mdash; rather than you ending up a blank page that's of no use to you!
* ***'Data'* conservation** &mdash; We have tried to optimise the amount of information your device needs to receive in order to visit and use the Boston T Party website. This will hopefully limit the *'hit'* to your data usage.

## Roadmap (future)

We intend to continually tweak our website to make it as usable and enjoyable to use as possible. Here are some potential features / enhancements we've earmarked for future development:

* **Homepage redesign** &mdash; We hope to make the homepage (the page most people visit first) as visually pleasing, easy to use and informative as possible.
* **Photo gallery** &mdash; A place to view some lovely pics of Boston T party.
* **Light / Dark Theme option** &mdash; To allow you to choose what colour contrast option you prefer / is easier on your eyes when reading content.
