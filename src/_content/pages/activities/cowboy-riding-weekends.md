[Glencall Cowboys](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100078836859229&mibextid=ZbWKwL) is a working ranch so the horses are amazing. They're so sure footed & calm when riding up and down the beautiful mountains near Midmar Dam, KZN Midlands.

We ride in Western saddles and rides are guided by Charlie, a working cowboy. It's a truly authentic experience.

The "<abbr title="Boston T Party."><b>BTP</b></abbr>" &mdash; (*that's us*) &mdash;  offer rustic, comfortable [accommodation](/accommodation), with [beautiful grounds](/gallery#btp-grounds) situated on a dam. A wonderfully tranquil and peaceful environment.
