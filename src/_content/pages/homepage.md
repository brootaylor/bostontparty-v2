Boston T Party is perfect if you need [somewhere to stay][1] or a funky [venue to hold your function][2].

A homely, farm experience. Cast a line from the jetty, jump in a canoe and paddle round the dam or relax on the lawn under the Willow trees.

This is a super spot to enjoy beautiful sunsets, a roaring bonfire or head off for a cycle or walk in the surrounding area.
