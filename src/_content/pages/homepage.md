A **homely**, **personal**, **farm experience**, where you can cast a line from the jetty, jump in a canoe and paddle around the dam or relax on the lawn under the Willow trees.

This is a super spot to enjoy beautiful sunsets, a roaring bonfire or head off for a cycle or walk in the surrounding area or just rejuvenate your soul sitting near the dam watching the ducks!
