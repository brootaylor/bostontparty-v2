Rory & Sue Brighton along with Milo, Maddy and Squeak, our furry friends, and Apple & Blossom, the sweet cats, are ready to welcome you to our home!

From individual leisure guests to groups, backpackers, campers, bikers & hikers, birthday celebrations and bull's parties, we invite you to come and enjoy our beautiful surroundings and relaxing atmosphere.

A homely, personal, farm experience, where you can cast a line from the jetty, jump in a canoe and paddle around the dam or relax on the lawn under the Willow trees.

This is a super spot to enjoy beautiful sunsets, a roaring bonfire or head off for a cycle or walk in the surrounding area or just rejuvenate your soul sitting near the dam watching the ducks!

**All are welcome &mdash; but not your pets, sorry!**
