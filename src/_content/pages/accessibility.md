## Accessibility features

The code powering this website is [standards-compliant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://www.w3.org/standards/).

The pages are structured with semantic elements like <code>header</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>main</code> and <code>footer</code>. Hopefully this will help you move around more quickly. Heading <code>h1</code> elements mark the main content area of each page, and each page’s structure should follow a logical heading order from there.

Every page on this website has a “*skip to the main content*” link at the top and bottom, as well as a “*back to top*" link at the very bottom which will return you to the start of this page / document.

Images and inline SVGs are described with text equivalents, to ensure everyone can access graphical content. You should be able to zoom each page up to at least 300% without any issues.

All form <code>label</code> and associated <code>input</code> fields use a unique value for their respective <code>for</code> and <code>id</code> attributes.

There are no <code>javascript:</code> pseudo-links. All links can be followed in any browser, even if scripting is turned off. There are no links that open new windows without warning.
