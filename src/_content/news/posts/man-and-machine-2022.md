This is the 9th Man and Machine event and entries opened on the 1st May. Previous years entrants will have preference.

**Entries are limited**.

This event is not a race, but a test of man and machine against the elements. This is an adventure which tests the skill and endurance of the weekend warrior and professional racers alike.

Here's a [peak of what's in store](https://youtu.be/09sr_Aus7zA).

We work closely with local farmers and the rural communities to provide a safe and successful event. The 2 days of riding will cater for the intermediate and hard skill levels. The distance over the 2 days will be approximately 150 - 200km.

The object of the weekend is to successfully complete both days, and receive your finishers trophy at prize giving.

**No Finish No Trophy**.

Hope to see you there!

Dino, Alison, Rory and Sue
