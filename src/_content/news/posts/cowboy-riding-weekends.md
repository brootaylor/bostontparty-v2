**Glencall Cowboys** is a working ranch so the horses are amazing. They're so sure footed & calm when riding up and down the beautiful mountains near Midmar Dam, KZN Midlands.

We ride in Western saddles and rides are guided by Charlie, a working cowboy. It's a truly authentic experience.

The "<abbr title="Boston T Party."><b>BTP</b></abbr>" &mdash; (*that's us*) &mdash;  offer rustic, comfortable accommodation, with beautiful grounds situated on a dam. A wonderfully tranquil and peaceful environment.

Head on over to our [Cowboy Riding Weekends](/activities/cowboy-riding-weekends) page to find out more.
