This was the 10<sup>th</sup> Man and Machine event and proved to be a real success!

The event is not a race, but a test of man and machine against the elements. It's an adventure which tests the skill and endurance of the weekend warrior and professional racer alike.

We work closely with local farmers and the rural communities to provide a safe and successful event. The 2 days of riding cater for the intermediate and hard skill levels. The distance over the 2 days is approximately 150 &ndash; 200km.

The object of the weekend is to successfully complete both days, and receive your finishers trophy at prize giving.

**No Finish No Trophy**.

Thank you for your support in 2023. We hope to see you in 2024!

Dino, Alison, Rory &amp; Sue
