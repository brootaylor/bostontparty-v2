Monday 9th is Woman’s Day, allowing a day for those that need to travel back home after the event. Entries will open 1st May for previous entrants and 15th May for all remaining places.

This is the 9th Man and Machine event.

This event is not a race, but a test of man and machine against the elements. This is an adventure which tests the skill and endurance of the weekend warrior and professional racers alike.

We work closely with local farmers and the rural communities to provide a safe and successful event. The 2 days of riding will cater for the intermediate and hard skill levels. The distance over the 2 days will be approximately 150 - 200 km. Entries are limited.

Previous years entrants will have preference. The object of the weekend is to successfully complete both days, and receive your finishers trophy at prize giving.

No Finish No Trophy.
