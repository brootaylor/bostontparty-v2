This is the 11<sup>th</sup> Man and Machine event and entries open in May 2024.

Previous years entrants will have preference.

**Entries are limited**.

The event is not a race, but a test of man and machine against the elements. It's an adventure which tests the skill and endurance of the weekend warrior and professional racer alike.

Here's a [peak of what's in store](https://www.youtube.com/@manandmachinesa4872).

We work closely with local farmers and the rural communities to provide a safe and successful event. The 2 days of riding cater for the intermediate and hard skill levels. The distance over the 2 days is approximately 150 &ndash; 200km.

The object of the weekend is to successfully complete both days, and receive your finishers trophy at prize giving.

**No Finish No Trophy**.

Hope to see you there!

Dino, Alison, Rory &amp; Sue
