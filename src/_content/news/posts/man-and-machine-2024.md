Weâ€™d like to take this opportunity to thank all riders, sponsors and service providers, for what has been an awesome event since inception in 2012, for your support over the years.

We have gotten to know many of you in a personal capacity over the years and will miss our interactions with you.

If you have entered and paid, you will receive an email during the course of this week, from M&M, regarding your refund.

All the best,

Dino, Alison, Rory & Sue
